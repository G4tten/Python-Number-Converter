# Python-Number-Converter
Python program with terminal interface that converts Roman numerals to integers and vice versa.

A small project to *challenge oneself in implementing basic functions*. **Fork this repository** and try to redo this project with a different code! ;)

- Project idea and code to convert Roman numerals to integers of [Dnoxal](https://github.com/Dnoxal)
- Implementation of code to convert integer numbers to Roman numerals and menus made by me

**Any contribution or improvement to the code is welcome!**
